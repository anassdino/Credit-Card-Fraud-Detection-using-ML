# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-ML
Machine learning model using a supervised learning algorithm, such as descision trees or logistic regression, that can accurately detect credit card fraud using a large, publicly available dataset. The performance of the model will be evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score/accuracy.
