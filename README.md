# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-ML
Machine learning model using a supervised learning algorithm, such as descision trees or logistic regression, that can accurately detect credit card fraud using a large, publicly available dataset. The performance of the model will be evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score/accuracy. 



1.	Data Collection: I'll start by collecting a large, publicly available dataset that contains information about credit card transactions and whether they are fraudulent or not.
2.	Data Preprocessing: i'll proceed to clean and preprocess the data by removing any missing values, handling outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.
3.	Model Selection: Select two machine learning algorithms to implement the models.
4.	Model Implementation: Implement the two models using Python and any relevant libraries, such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow. Train the models using the preprocessed data and evaluate the performance of the models using standard evaluation metrics, such as accuracy.
5.	Model Comparison: Compare the performance of the two models and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.
6.	Model Interpretation: Create visualizations and generate insights to understand why the models are making certain predictions.
7.	Model Deployment: Create a web-based interface or mobile application to deploy the best-performing model, so users can interact with the system and view the results.
